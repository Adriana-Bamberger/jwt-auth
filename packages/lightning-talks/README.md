# Lightning Talks

Yay! 

⚡️ Lightning talks! ⚡️

This is your chance to learn a little about a new topic and share what you have learned with others in the cohort. 

We can't dive deep into every interesting subject, but between many of us, we can take a peek at what they're about. In a dev team, these topics are often pieces of tech you're planning use, or different options we're deciding between. Here, we'll use it to learn some cool stuff we might not otherwise cover.

**The idea of a lightning talk is not that you'll be an expert, but that you will be completely new to the topic yourself. For this reason, please don't pick a topic you are already familiar with.**

This is an opportunity to practice learning about a completely unknown area. What things are important? What did I find interesting? What will help others understand the topic?

This is also a good chance to practice giving and receiving actionable, specific, and kind feedback. We will ask that each of you provide feedback to each other about what things you liked about a talk, and what might've helped you understand things better, so that we can get better at conveying technical things to people who don't know what we're talking about!

## Important!

There are two files in this repo, one for each week. Select the relevant one for you and follow the instructions inside.

- Lightning talks will be at **2pm** on the days listed.

- Talks should be **3-5 minutes**. They are an intro to a topic, not a deep dive.

- You should only spend an hour researching. Again, we're not looking for you to be an expert.

#### For in-person presentations

- Try not to use notes, we just want to hear about the things you learned/find interesting, but it's okay if you do need to use some prompts.

- No computer/projector use, but there are plenty of whiteboards or flipchart paper

- If you have a lot to write up, remember, you can always prepare the whiteboard before your talk!

#### For online presentations

- Slides are optional but encouraged. 

- Try to make your slides primarily pictures, diagrams and/or bullet points, not wordy text.

- You want to be talking in your natural voice, not reading from the slides or your notes. 

- A live demo is also welcome (this will be more challenging than slides).
